# BERT Classifier for Product Reviews

An implementation of a [Text Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) using the [Google BERT library](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html). 

Uses the [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) to classify text by reviewer rating. The full list of features are described [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt).


Available as a python script and Jupyter Notebook. Both require the following non-core python libraries to run: 

```
numpy
pandas 
sklearn
tensorflow

```
